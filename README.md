asset for Steam.  This dataset is generated entirely from public Steam data. This dataset is publicly available in kaggle.

 
 ## Objectives
  1. Exploration and Analysis of steam-200k.csv dataset.
  2. Create rating using Expectation Maximization algorithm
  3. Generate recommendations using collaborative filtering algorithm: SVD Algorithm.
  4. Improving and optimizing SVD algorithm performance using Stochastic Gradient Descent.

  
## Metrics
  Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) is used as metrics.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
